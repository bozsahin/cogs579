METU course on Philosophy of Computer Science

This is the web home when I teach it. This page is the course syllabus.

NOTE: During registration, the course is open to II students, PHIL, BIOL, PHYS and CENG grad students, and CENG
seniors. I will open to others during ADD/DROP. 

Please send me an email so that I can invite you to the first meeting even if you're not registered.
If you are eligible, you can register during add/drop.

<b>Lectures:</b> Thursdays, 11.40-14.30, at room S03. Second room on the first right, entering through main gate of Informatics.

The course is face to face.

<b>Lecturer:</b> Cem Bozsahin (Spring 2024)

<b>TA:</b> Rojda Ozcan

<b>Catalog Content and Description:</b>

Philosophical questions in the practice of computer science: what is a computer; what kind of science is computer science; what are the terms of computationalist explanations; are digital and analog computers different in kind; does nature compute? computers and exploration; ethics of computers with or without human in the loop; activity of programming; paradigms of thinking in computer science.

<b>Background Requirements:</b>

The course aims to bring together advanced undergraduates and graduates of philosophy, computer science and cognitive science. Advanced undergraduate standing in one of these fields, or studying one of these fields at the graduate level, or having a focus on the topic in a related field (such as physics, mathematics, linguistics, biology) is required. We do not teach programming, and assume that its intellectual aspects (e.g. program and data abstraction) are well-known through first-hand experience. First-hand experience means being able to program beyond using library functions and packaged tools. You must have gone through one programming design
experience, no matter how small.

<em>NOTE TO ALL STUDENTS: If you have not done programming by designing and writing your own programs, large or small, I advise
you NOT to take this course. Using libraries or studying someoneelse'e code or auto-generated code do not
count as programming experience in my book. You have to be in the programmer's shoes in this course.</em>

<em>NOTE TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS: This course thrives on in-class discussion and off-class writing.
It also includes taking responsibility of presenting a paper. We know that you have the right to withdraw
from a course, but that can disrupt the course if you withdraw close to your presentation. Please think thoroughly before you register for the course. </em>

<b>Course Objectives:</b>

What kind of thinking is involved when humans choose to study a problem computationally? This is the general question of the course.
At this day and age, it is inevitable to get into AI issues, and we do so. But this is NOT a course on AI. It's about Computer Science in general.

At the end of the course, students are expected to assess (a) the potential role of computers in scientific explanation, (b) the nature of computing (algorithms, analogs, etc.), (c) ethical aspects with and without human in the loop, (d) conceptual problems related to computer science.


<b>Course Textbooks:</b> (both are partially covered, subject to change in 2024)

1. Rapaport, William (2020). Philosophy of Computer Science. OpenLibra.

This textbook is great for bringing yourself up to speed for the course,
if (a) you know computers but not philosophy, (b) you know philosophy
but not how computers relate to it. A bit of both I will assume to be common background.

The ethic part is the one we will cover in class.

2. Weizenbaum, Joseph (1976). Computer Power and Human Reason. W.H. Freeman and Company.

This is a nowadays neglected classic. If you don't have an understanding
of the inner workings of a computer but know programming, there are great chapters
here to help you with that. But it's much more than that, outlining a philosophy of
computer science that seems much relevant today, what with all that transhumanism
and posthumanism.
