METU course on Philosophy of Computer Science

This is the web home when I teach it. This page is the course syllabus.

<b>Lecturer</b> Cem Bozsahin (Spring 2021)

<b>TA</b> Firat Oter (Spring 2021)

<b>Catalog Content and Description</b>

Philosophical questions in the practice of computer science in relation to AI and philosophy: what is a computer; what kind of science is computer science; what are the terms of computationalist explanations; are digital and analog computers different in kind; does nature compute? computers and exploration; ethics of computers with or without human in the loop; meta-activity of programming; paradigms of thinking in computer science.

<b>Background Requirements</b>

The course aims to bring together advanced undergraduates and graduates of philosophy, computer science and cognitive science. Advanced undergraduate standing in one of these fields, or studying one of these fields at the graduate level, or having a focus on the topic in a related field (such as physics, mathematics, linguistics, biology) is required. We do not teach programming, and assume that its intellectual aspects (e.g. program and data abstraction) are well-known through first-hand experience.

<em>If you have not done programming by designing and writing your own programs, large or small, I advise
you not to take this course. Using libraries or studying someoneelse'e code do not
count as programming experience in my book. You have to be in programmer's shoes in this course.</em>


<b>Course Objectives</b>

At the end of the course, students are expected to assess (a) the potential role of computers in scientific explanation, (b) the nature of computing (algorithms, analogs, etc.), (c) ethical aspects with and without human in the loop, (d) conceptual problems related to computer science.


<b>Course Textbook</b> 

Rapaport, William (2020). Philosophy of Computer Science. OpenLibra.

The textbook is great for bringing yourself up to speed for the course,
if (a) you know computers but not philosophy, (b) you know philosophy
but not computers. A bit of both I will assume to be common background.

The ethic part is the one we will cover in class.
